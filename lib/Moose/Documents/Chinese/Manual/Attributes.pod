=head1 簡介

Moose 屬性（attributes）有許多特點，屬性也許是 Moose 最強大和最有彈性的部份。
你可以藉由宣告屬性來建立一個類別。
事實上，很可能有許多類別僅僅由屬性宣告組成。

一個屬性是所有類別實體都會共有的特性。
例如，我們可以說所有的 C<Person> 物件都有名和姓。
屬性可以是可選的，我們也可以說有些 C<Person> 物件有社會安全號碼（而有些沒有）。

最簡單的想，一個屬性可以被想成一個有名字的值（像是在雜湊內），可以被讀取和賦值。
不過，屬性也可以有預設值，型別限制，委任和其他功能。

在其他語言中，屬性也可能稱為插槽（slots）或是特性（properties）。

=head1 屬性選項

使用 C<has> 函式宣告屬性：

  package Person;

  use Moose;

  has 'first_name' => ( is => 'rw' );

這宣告所有的 C<Person> 物件會有一個可選的，可讀寫的 first_name 屬性。

=head2 可讀寫與唯讀

傳給 C<has> 的選項定義了此屬性的特性。
有許多選項，最簡單的形式下你只需要設定 C<is>，其值可以是 C<ro>（唯讀）或是 C<rw>（可讀寫）。
當屬性是 C<rw>，你可以傳值給存取器來改變屬性值。
當屬性是 C<ro>，你只能讀取其值。

事實上，你能不要給 C<is>，但你會得到一個沒有存取器的屬性。
有某些屬性選項時，這可能會有用，像是 C<handles>。
不過，如果你的屬性C<沒有>產生存取器，Moose 會警告，因為這通常代表程式設計師忘了說此屬性為唯讀或可讀寫。
如果你真的不想要存取器，你可以賦值 C<is> 為 C<bare> 來關閉此警告。

=head2 存取器方法

每個屬性有一個或多個存取器方法。一個存取器讓你讀寫一個物件的屬性。

預設上，存取器方法和屬性同名。
如果你宣告你的屬性為C<唯讀>，你的存取器就是唯讀。
如果將其宣告為C<可讀寫>，你得到一個可讀寫的存取器。

以前面的 C<Person> 為例，我們現在有一個唯一的 C<first_name> 存取器可以讀寫 C<Person> 物件的 C<first_name> 屬性值。

如果你希望，你也可以明確指定用來讀寫屬性的方法名稱。
這在你希望屬性是可以公開讀取但是只供內部寫入時非常有用。
例如：

  has 'weight' => (
      is     => 'ro',
      writer => '_set_weight',
  );

這在 weight 是由其他方法計算出時也許很有用。
例如，每次 C<eat> 方法被呼叫時我們都調整 weight。
這讓我們隱藏更改 weight 的實作細節，但仍然提供此類別的使用者 weight 的值。

有些人也許傾向有使用明確區別的方法來分別執行讀寫。
在 I<Perl 最佳實務>一書中，Damian Conway 就建議 reader 方法以「get_」為字首而 writer 方法以「set_」為字首。

我們可以明確提供名字給 C<reader> 和 C<writer> 方法：

  has 'weight' => (
      is     => 'rw',
      reader => 'get_weight',
      writer => 'set_weight',
  );

如果你覺得重複這樣寫真是冗長得令人發瘋，你是對的！
幸運的是，Moose 提供一組外掛系統讓你覆寫命名慣例。
請閱讀 L<Moose::Documents::Chinese::Manual::MooseX> 了解詳情。

=head2 Predicate and clearer methods

Moose allows you to explicitly distinguish between a false or
undefined attribute value and an attribute which has not been set. If
you want to access this information, you must define clearer and
predicate methods for an attribute.

A predicate method tells you whether or not a given attribute is
currently set. Note that an attribute can be explicitly set to
C<undef> or some other false value, but the predicate will return
true.

The clearer method unsets the attribute. This is I<not> the
same as setting the value to C<undef>, but you can only distinguish
between them if you define a predicate method!

Here's some code to illustrate the relationship between an accessor,
predicate, and clearer method.

  package Person;

  use Moose;

  has 'ssn' => (
      is        => 'rw',
      clearer   => 'clear_ssn',
      predicate => 'has_ssn',
  );

  ...

  my $person = Person->new();
  $person->has_ssn; # false

  $person->ssn(undef);
  $person->ssn; # returns undef
  $person->has_ssn; # true

  $person->clear_ssn;
  $person->ssn; # returns undef
  $person->has_ssn; # false

  $person->ssn('123-45-6789');
  $person->ssn; # returns '123-45-6789'
  $person->has_ssn; # true

  my $person2 = Person->new( ssn => '111-22-3333');
  $person2->has_ssn; # true

By default, Moose does not make a predicate or clearer for you. You must
explicitly provide names for them, and then Moose will create the methods
for you.

=head2 Required or not?

By default, all attributes are optional, and do not need to be
provided at object construction time. If you want to make an attribute
required, simply set the C<required> option to true:

  has 'name' => (
      is       => 'ro',
      required => 1,
  );

There are a couple caveats worth mentioning in regards to what
"required" actually means.

Basically, all it says is that this attribute (C<name>) must be provided to
the constructor, or be lazy with either a default or a builder. It does not
say anything about its value, so it could be C<undef>.

If you define a clearer method on a required attribute, the clearer
I<will> work, so even a required attribute can be unset after object
construction.

This means that if you do make an attribute required, providing a
clearer doesn't make much sense. In some cases, it might be handy to
have a I<private> C<clearer> and C<predicate> for a required
attribute.

=head2 Default and builder methods

Attributes can have default values, and Moose provides two ways to
specify that default.

In the simplest form, you simply provide a non-reference scalar value
for the C<default> option:

  has 'size' => (
      is        => 'ro',
      default   => 'medium',
      predicate => 'has_size',
  );

If the size attribute is not provided to the constructor, then it ends
up being set to C<medium>:

  my $person = Person->new();
  $person->size; # medium
  $person->has_size; # true

You can also provide a subroutine reference for C<default>. This
reference will be called as a method on the object.

  has 'size' => (
      is => 'ro',
      default =>
          sub { ( 'small', 'medium', 'large' )[ int( rand 3 ) ] },
      predicate => 'has_size',
  );

This is a trivial example, but it illustrates the point that the subroutine
will be called for every new object created.

When you provide a C<default> subroutine reference, it is called as a
method on the object, with no additional parameters:

  has 'size' => (
      is      => 'ro',
      default => sub {
          my $self = shift;

          return $self->height > 200 ? 'large' : 'average';
      },
  );

When the C<default> is called during object construction, it may be
called before other attributes have been set. If your default is
dependent on other parts of the object's state, you can make the
attribute C<lazy>. Laziness is covered in the next section.

If you want to use a reference of any sort as the default value, you
must return it from a subroutine.

  has 'mapping' => (
      is      => 'ro',
      default => sub { {} },
  );

This is necessary because otherwise Perl would instantiate the reference
exactly once, and it would be shared by all objects:

  has 'mapping' => (
      is      => 'ro',
      default => {}, # wrong!
  );

Moose will throw an error if you pass a bare non-subroutine reference
as the default.

If Moose allowed this then the default mapping attribute could easily
end up shared across many objects. Instead, wrap it in a subroutine
reference as we saw above.

This is a bit awkward, but it's just the way Perl works.

As an alternative to using a subroutine reference, you can supply a C<builder>
method for your attribute:

  has 'size' => (
      is        => 'ro',
      builder   => '_build_size',
      predicate => 'has_size',
  );

  sub _build_size {
      return ( 'small', 'medium', 'large' )[ int( rand 3 ) ];
  }

This has several advantages. First, it moves a chunk of code to its own named
method, which improves readability and code organization. Second, because this
is a I<named> method, it can be subclassed or provided by a role.

We strongly recommend that you use a C<builder> instead of a
C<default> for anything beyond the most trivial default.

A C<builder>, just like a C<default>, is called as a method on the
object with no additional parameters.

=head3 Builders allow subclassing

Because the C<builder> is called I<by name>, it goes through Perl's
method resolution. This means that builder methods are both
inheritable and overridable.

If we subclass our C<Person> class, we can override C<_build_size>:

  package Lilliputian;

  use Moose;
  extends 'Person';

  sub _build_size { return 'small' }

=head3 Builders work well with roles

Because builders are called by name, they work well with roles. For
example, a role could provide an attribute but require that the
consuming class provide the C<builder>:

  package HasSize;
  use Moose::Role;

  requires '_build_size';

  has 'size' => (
      is      => 'ro',
      lazy    => 1,
      builder => '_build_size',
  );

  package Lilliputian;
  use Moose;

  with 'HasSize';

  sub _build_size { return 'small' }

Roles are covered in L<Moose::Manual::Roles>.

=head2 Laziness

Moose lets you defer attribute population by making an attribute
C<lazy>:

  has 'size' => (
      is      => 'ro',
      lazy    => 1,
      builder => '_build_size',
  );

When C<lazy> is true, the default is not generated until the reader
method is called, rather than at object construction time. There are
several reasons you might choose to do this.

First, if the default value for this attribute depends on some other
attributes, then the attribute I<must> be C<lazy>. During object
construction, defaults are not generated in a predictable order, so
you cannot count on some other attribute being populated when
generating a default.

Second, there's often no reason to calculate a default before it's
needed. Making an attribute C<lazy> lets you defer the cost until the
attribute is needed. If the attribute is I<never> needed, you save
some CPU time.

We recommend that you make any attribute with a builder or non-trivial
default C<lazy> as a matter of course.

=head2 Constructor parameters (C<init_arg>)

By default, each attribute can be passed by name to the class's
constructor. On occasion, you may want to use a different name for
the constructor parameter. You may also want to make an attribute
unsettable via the constructor.

You can do either of these things with the C<init_arg> option:

  has 'bigness' => (
      is       => 'ro',
      init_arg => 'size',
  );

Now we have an attribute named "bigness", but we pass C<size> to the
constructor.

Even more useful is the ability to disable setting an attribute via
the constructor. This is particularly handy for private attributes:

  has '_genetic_code' => (
      is       => 'ro',
      lazy     => 1,
      builder  => '_build_genetic_code',
      init_arg => undef,
  );

By setting the C<init_arg> to C<undef>, we make it impossible to set
this attribute when creating a new object.

=head2 Weak references

Moose has built-in support for weak references. If you set the
C<weak_ref> option to a true value, then it will call
C<Scalar::Util::weaken> whenever the attribute is set:

  has 'parent' => (
      is       => 'rw',
      weak_ref => 1,
  );

  $node->parent($parent_node);

This is very useful when you're building objects that may contain
circular references.

When the object in a weak references goes out of scope, the attribute's value
will become C<undef> "behind the scenes". This is done by the Perl interpreter
directly, so Moose does not see this change. This means that triggers don't
fire, coercions aren't applied, etc.

The attribute is not cleared, so a predicate method for that attribute will
still return true. Similarly, when the attribute is next accessed, a default
value will not be generated.

=head2 Triggers

A C<trigger> is a subroutine that is called whenever the attribute is
set:

  has 'size' => (
      is      => 'rw',
      trigger => \&_size_set,
  );

  sub _size_set {
      my ( $self, $size, $old_size ) = @_;

      my $msg = $self->name;

      if ( @_ > 2 ) {
          $msg .= " - old size was $old_size";
      }

      $msg .= " - size is now $size";
      warn $msg;
  }

The trigger is called I<after> an attribute's value is set. It is
called as a method on the object, and receives the new and old values as
its arguments. If the attribute had not previously been set at all,
then only the new value is passed. This lets you distinguish between
the case where the attribute had no value versus when the old value was C<undef>.

This differs from an C<after> method modifier in two ways. First, a
trigger is only called when the attribute is set, as opposed to
whenever the accessor method is called (for reading or
writing). Second, it is also called when an attribute's value is
passed to the constructor.

However, triggers are I<not> called when an attribute is populated
from a C<default> or C<builder>.

=head2 Attribute types

Attributes can be restricted to only accept certain types:

  has 'first_name' => (
      is  => 'ro',
      isa => 'Str',
  );

This says that the C<first_name> attribute must be a string.

Moose also provides a shortcut for specifying that an attribute only
accepts objects that do a certain role:

  has 'weapon' => (
      is   => 'rw',
      does => 'MyApp::Weapon',
  );

See the L<Moose::Manual::Types> documentation for a complete
discussion of Moose's type system.

=head2 Delegation

An attribute can define methods which simply delegate to its value:

  has 'hair_color' => (
      is      => 'ro',
      isa     => 'Graphics::Color::RGB',
      handles => { hair_color_hex => 'as_hex_string' },
  );

This adds a new method, C<hair_color_hex>. When someone calls
C<hair_color_hex>, internally, the object just calls C<<
$self->hair_color->as_hex_string >>.

See L<Moose::Manual::Delegation> for documentation on how to set up
delegation methods.

=head2 Attribute traits and metaclasses

One of Moose's best features is that it can be extended in all sorts of ways
through the use of metaclass traits and custom metaclasses.

You can apply one or more traits to an attribute:

  use MooseX::MetaDescription;

  has 'size' => (
      is          => 'ro',
      traits      => ['MooseX::MetaDescription::Meta::Trait'],
      description => {
          html_widget  => 'text_input',
          serialize_as => 'element',
      },
  );

The advantage of traits is that you can mix more than one of them
together easily (in fact, a trait is just a role under the hood).

There are a number of MooseX modules on CPAN which provide useful
attribute metaclasses and traits. See L<Moose::Manual::MooseX> for
some examples. You can also write your own metaclasses and traits. See
the "Meta" and "Extending" recipes in L<Moose::Cookbook> for examples.

=head2 Native Delegations

Native delegations allow you to delegate to standard Perl data structures as
if they were objects.

For example, we can pretend that an array reference has methods like
C<push()>, C<shift()>, C<map()>, C<count()>, and more.

  has 'options' => (
      traits  => ['Array'],
      is      => 'ro',
      isa     => 'ArrayRef[Str]',
      default => sub { [] },
      handles => {
          all_options    => 'elements',
          add_option     => 'push',
          map_options    => 'map',
          option_count   => 'count',
          sorted_options => 'sort',
      },
  );

See L<Moose::Manual::Delegation> for more details.

=head1 ATTRIBUTE INHERITANCE

By default, a child inherits all of its parent class(es)' attributes
as-is. However, you can change most aspects of the inherited attribute in the
child class. You cannot change any of its associated method names (reader,
writer, predicate, etc).

To override an attribute, you simply prepend its name with a plus sign
(C<+>):

  package LazyPerson;

  use Moose;

  extends 'Person';

  has '+first_name' => (
      lazy    => 1,
      default => 'Bill',
  );

Now the C<first_name> attribute in C<LazyPerson> is lazy, and defaults
to C<'Bill'>.

We recommend that you exercise caution when changing the type (C<isa>)
of an inherited attribute.

=head1 MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE SHORTCUTS

If you have a number of attributes that differ only by name, you can declare
them all at once:

  package Point;

  use Moose;

  has [ 'x', 'y' ] => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Int' );

Also, because C<has> is just a function call, you can call it in a loop:

  for my $name ( qw( x y ) ) {
      my $builder = '_build_' . $name;
      has $name => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Int', builder => $builder );
  }

=head1 MORE ON ATTRIBUTES

Moose attributes are a big topic, and this document glosses over a few
aspects. We recommend that you read the L<Moose::Manual::Delegation>
and L<Moose::Manual::Types> documents to get a more complete
understanding of attribute features.

=head1 A FEW MORE OPTIONS

Moose has lots of attribute options. The ones listed below are
superseded by some more modern features, but are covered for the sake
of completeness.

=head2 The C<documentation> option

You can provide a piece of documentation as a string for an attribute:

  has 'first_name' => (
      is            => 'rw',
      documentation => q{The person's first (personal) name},
  );

Moose does absolutely nothing with this information other than store
it.

=head2 The C<auto_deref> option

If your attribute is an array reference or hash reference, the
C<auto_deref> option will make Moose dereference the value when it is
returned from the reader method:

  my %map = $object->mapping;

This option only works if your attribute is explicitly typed as an
C<ArrayRef> or C<HashRef>.

However, we recommend that you use L<Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native> traits
for these types of attributes, which gives you much more control over how
they are accessed and manipulated.

=head2 Initializer

Moose provides an attribute option called C<initializer>. This is called when
the attribute's value is being set in the constructor, and lets you change the
value before it is set.
